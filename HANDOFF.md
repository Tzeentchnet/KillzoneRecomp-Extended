This file is the session protocol for people and agents: how to start, which rules apply, how to check for
regressions, and how to hand off. It does not hold task status. That lives in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) and
[`WORKDONE.md`](WORKDONE.md).

## 1. Read order

1. [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - product requirements, work-package definitions,
   dependencies, acceptance commands, stop conditions, release gate and sign-offs. Authoritative for scope.
2. [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) - what is open, on which machine, and the next command.
3. [`WORKDONE.md`](WORKDONE.md) - what is proven, with evidence. Authoritative for completion.
4. This file - session rules.
5. [`README.md`](README.md) - build, test and BYOD workflows.
6. [`LEARNINGS.md`](LEARNINGS.md) - lessons from earlier sessions (lock updates, A/B tools, gates).

Code and passing acceptance commands override prose. Fix any stale document in the same session.

## 2. Session start

```powershell
Set-Location D:\Github\KillzoneRecomp-Extended
git status --short --untracked-files=all
git submodule status --recursive
python .\tools\scripts\verify_deps.py --strict
```

Preserve unrelated working-tree changes; integrate them instead of resetting or cleaning.

## 3. Parallel work

Labels used in `TODO.md`:

- **`[SUBAGENT-PARALLEL]`** - may run concurrently in an isolated worktree or branch, one writer per file scope.
- **`[READ-PARALLEL]`** - read-only investigation in the shared worktree; the parent session owns all edits.
- **`[SERIAL]`** - waits on dependencies, or must be done by the integration owner.
- **`[HUMAN]`** - needs a human decision or authorization; never delegate it as an approval.

Writer subagents never share a working tree. The macOS branches all touch `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`,
`README.md` and the status documents. Give each writer its own worktree and merge serially in one integration session.

Cross-compilation or emulation on Windows is not acceptance evidence for any AppleClang compile-and-run gate.

## 4. Windows regression set

Run from the repository root before handing off any change that can affect the build or runtime:

```powershell
python .\tools\scripts\verify_deps.py --strict
python .\tools\scripts\verify_resume_table.py .\generated
python .\tools\scripts\inventory_generated.py --check

tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-msvc-tests -Action build
tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-msvc-rel -Action test -Label iso-free

tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-clang-tests -Action build
tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-clang-rel -Action test -Label iso-free

git diff --check
```

Expected today: 31/0/0 dependency checks, both generated gates PASS (51 hook signatures and 101,715
recompiler-resumable entries), 12/12 ISO-free under each compiler. WIN-06 has its own gate,
`tools\scripts\win06_gate.ps1` (about 18 minutes for ten runs; see `LEARNINGS.md`). The focused PORT-01 gate is
`tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-clang-rel -Action build -Target kz_host_core`.

The recompiler is built separately: `tools\scripts\build_ps2recomp.bat` (output in `build\ps2recomp`). Rebuild it
before `regen.py` whenever `ext/PS2Recomp` changes.

## 5. Privacy and repository rules

- Never commit the retail ISO, `SCUS_974.02`, the function-map CSV, regeneration logs, `work/`, or anything under the
  private generated tree.
- Do not copy private inputs into reports, prompts, issue bodies or external services.
- Committed provenance may contain hashes, counts, bounds and signature hashes only.
- BYOD tests stay separately labeled and disabled by default.
- Preserve the fixed hook addresses and validate them with `inventory_generated.py`; never retarget a hook to make a
  test pass.
- Keep the GitHub origin private until a human decides to publish it. Agents must not change repository visibility.
- Another machine may fetch the committed implementation from the private `origin/master`. Retail content, private
  function maps and generated sources must be provisioned separately on an authorized host.

## 6. End-of-session update

Before handing off:

1. Update the task's entry in `TODO.md` (status, evidence so far, next command, blocker).
2. If the task passed its plan acceptance, move it to `WORKDONE.md` with commit, machine, commands and exact results.
3. Add any new evidence to `docs/findings.md` and any runtime patch rationale to `patches/README.md`.
4. Add any lesson that would have saved this session time to `LEARNINGS.md`.
5. Replace the session record below.
6. When a milestone changes state or a role signs off, update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (section 12, approval status).

## 7. Latest session record

```text
Task: Defer STAB-01; complete WIN-01 and WIN-03
Owner/session: Copilot SDK in VS Code, 2026-10-20
Machine: Windows 11 x64; MSVC and clang-cl presets; D3D12 on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070
Status: STAB-01 investigation is deferred by project decision and remains an M4/release blocker. WIN-01 and WIN-03 are complete in WORKDONE. BASE-01 still needs hands-on acceptance.
Files changed: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md; README.md; TODO.md; WORKDONE.md; docs/findings.md; LEARNINGS.md; HANDOFF.md; src/kz_launcher.cpp; src/kz_win06_watch.cpp; src/kz_hook_addresses.h; config/generated-manifest.json; config/dependencies.lock.json; patches/README.md; patches/ps2recomp/0032-standalone-runtime-test-suite.patch; patches/ps2recomp/combined.lock.diff; ext/PS2Recomp gitlink. The temporary generated allocator trace was removed.
Acceptance commands and exact results: STAB diagnostics `win06_listoverlap1` 8/10 and `win06_heapword1` 7/10, then deferred without a workaround. D3D11 hardware golden PASS at 1x/2x with zero mismatches; chapter 1 run exit 0 with nonblack frames; actual swap-chain frames 55.5-71.4% nonblack; original 90-second run exit 0 with advancing nonblack frames. Standalone PS2Recomp suite PASS 439/439. verify_deps.py --strict PASS 31/0/0; resume table PASS 132,656/100,661/31,995; generated inventory PASS (54 hooks, 101,715 resumable entries); MSVC ISO-free 13/13; clang-cl ISO-free 13/13; git diff checks PASS.
New facts or decisions: the historical D3D11 all-zero defect no longer reproduces on the same RTX 5070/driver and stale warnings were removed. WIN-03 combined a stale PCM fixture, a null-runtime libsd probe, zero-CL VIF semantics, and stale regression expectations; PS2Recomp commit 93d19aa fixes them. The later STAB arms did not reproduce the list/vector overlap and instead caught allocator bin/candidate corruption directly, so that alias is not assumed to be the universal first fault.
Blocker and minimal reproducer: BASE-01 requires a human play-test with all testing options disabled. STAB-01 remains deferred but its standard reproducer is tools\scripts\win06_gate.ps1 -Runs 10 -Name <name> -Card work\win04_20261019_card -Iso <image> -Elf game\SCUS_974.02.
Next command: perform the BASE-01 hands-on D3D12 run: create/select a profile, play the first mission, save/load, return to the front end, and check high-refresh timing, mouse aim, controller input and clean shutdown with all testing options off.
Safe parallel work: none in the active M0 queue; reactivating STAB-01 requires reprioritization.
```
