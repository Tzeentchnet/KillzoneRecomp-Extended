This file is the session protocol for people and agents: how to start, which rules apply, how to check for
regressions, and how to hand off. It does not hold task status. That lives in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) and
[`WORKDONE.md`](WORKDONE.md).

## 1. Read order

1. [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) - product requirements, work-package definitions,
   dependencies, acceptance commands, stop conditions, release gate and sign-offs. Authoritative for scope.
2. [`TODO.md`](TODO.md) - what is open, on which machine, and the next command.
3. [`WORKDONE.md`](WORKDONE.md) - what is proven, with evidence. Authoritative for completion.
4. This file - session rules.
5. [`README.md`](README.md) - build, test and BYOD workflows.

Code and passing acceptance commands override prose. Fix any stale document in the same session.

## 2. Session start

```powershell
Set-Location D:\Github\KillzoneRecomp-Extended
git status --short --untracked-files=all
git submodule status --recursive
python .\tools\scripts\verify_deps.py --strict
```

Preserve unrelated working-tree changes; integrate them instead of resetting or cleaning.

## 3. Parallel work

Labels used in `TODO.md`:

- **`[SUBAGENT-PARALLEL]`** - may run concurrently in an isolated worktree or branch, one writer per file scope.
- **`[READ-PARALLEL]`** - read-only investigation in the shared worktree; the parent session owns all edits.
- **`[SERIAL]`** - waits on dependencies, or must be done by the integration owner.
- **`[HUMAN]`** - needs a human decision or authorization; never delegate it as an approval.

Writer subagents never share a working tree. The macOS branches all touch `CMakeLists.txt`, `CMakePresets.json`,
`README.md` and the status documents. Give each writer its own worktree and merge serially in one integration session.

Cross-compilation or emulation on Windows is not acceptance evidence for any AppleClang compile-and-run gate.

## 4. Windows regression set

Run from the repository root before handing off any change that can affect the build or runtime:

```powershell
python .\tools\scripts\verify_deps.py --strict
python .\tools\scripts\verify_resume_table.py .\generated
python .\tools\scripts\inventory_generated.py --check

tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-msvc-tests -Action build
tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-msvc-rel -Action test -Label iso-free

tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-clang-tests -Action build
tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-clang-rel -Action test -Label iso-free

git diff --check
```

Expected today: 31/0/0 dependency checks, both generated gates PASS, 12/12 ISO-free under each compiler. The focused
PORT-01 gate is `tools\scripts\cmake_preset.ps1 -Preset win-clang-rel -Action build -Target kz_host_core`.

The recompiler is built separately: `tools\scripts\build_ps2recomp.bat` (output in `build\ps2recomp`). Rebuild it
before `regen.py` whenever `ext/PS2Recomp` changes.

## 5. Privacy and repository rules

- Never commit the retail ISO, `SCUS_974.02`, the function-map CSV, regeneration logs, `work/`, or anything under the
  private generated tree.
- Do not copy private inputs into reports, prompts, issue bodies or external services.
- Committed provenance may contain hashes, counts, bounds and signature hashes only.
- BYOD tests stay separately labeled and disabled by default.
- Preserve the fixed hook addresses and validate them with `inventory_generated.py`; never retarget a hook to make a
  test pass.
- Keep the GitHub origin private until a human decides to publish it. Agents must not change repository visibility.
- Another machine may fetch the committed implementation from the private `origin/master`. Retail content, private
  function maps and generated sources must be provisioned separately on an authorized host.

## 6. End-of-session update

Before handing off:

1. Update the task's entry in `TODO.md` (status, evidence so far, next command, blocker).
2. If the task passed its plan acceptance, move it to `WORKDONE.md` with commit, machine, commands and exact results.
3. Add any new evidence to `docs/findings.md` and any runtime patch rationale to `patches/README.md`.
4. Replace the session record below.
5. When a milestone changes state or a role signs off, update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` (section 12, approval status).

Session record template:

```text

New facts or decisions:

## 7. Latest session record

```text
Task: WIN-02 unlock all campaign levels; WIN-05 testing start-up options (skip intro, start in chapter, test memory card); WIN-06 opened
Owner/session: Claude Code session, 2026-10-17
Machine: Windows 11 x64, clang-cl (win-clang-rel only)
Status: in progress (implemented; Windows regression set not yet run); WIN-06 parked by decision
Files changed: src/kz_testing.cpp/.h (new); src/kz_config.*; src/kz_launcher.cpp (Testing tab); src/kz_main.cpp (install, poll, test card, selftest); src/kz_input.* (kzInputTextEntryOpen, kzInputQueueText); src/kz_hook_addresses.h and config/generated-manifest.json (+5 hooks); docs/findings.md "Testing options"; IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (WIN-02 result, WIN-05, WIN-06); TODO.md; README.md
Acceptance commands and exact results: inventory_generated.py --check PASS (48 hook signatures); killzone.exe --selftest passed (0 failures); git diff --check clean; headless runs listed in docs/findings.md (work/t_* run folders, private)
New facts or decisions: the menus read campaign progress only through three PlayerProfile methods (developers' "Shooterman" profile cheat); the unlock never writes the profile; skip intro keeps the Intro script and skips only the Logos screen and the cinematic; start-in-chapter drives the game's own menus
Blocker and minimal reproducer: WIN-06 - KZ_START_LEVEL=11 (intro skipped) crashes or corrupts during the chapter 11 load in about 1 of 3 runs; 0 of 6 with the intro played
Next command: Windows regression set (section 4, both compilers); then WIN-06 with KZ_CRASH_TRACE=1
Safe parallel work: WIN-06 analysis in its own worktree; WIN-01, WIN-03
```
